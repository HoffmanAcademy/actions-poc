### Running Locally
- `npm install`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run start` or `npm run dev` to use nodemon

### Running in Docker
- `docker-compose build`. This will pull the base images, and install image dependencies
- `docker-compose up` to start the container. The app should then be running at http://localhost:3030
